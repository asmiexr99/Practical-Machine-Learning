Background


Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.



Prepare the datasets

Read the training data into a data table.
Loading Data
Training data
training_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/tesfamic/Desktop/coursera/practical machine learning/pml-training.csv") Testing data
training_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/tesfamic/Desktop/coursera/practical machine learning/pml-testing.csv") 
randomly splitting the training data in to two smaller training data 
set.seed(10)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y= training_data$classe, p=0.7, list=F)
training1 <- training_data[inTrain, ]
training2 <- training_data[-inTrain, ]

remove variables with nearly zero variance 

nzv <- nearZeroVar(training1)
training1 <- training1[, -nzv]
training2 <- training2[, -nzv]

remove variables with more than 95% missing values 

Remove_NA  <- sapply(training1, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
training1 <- training1[, Remove_NA==F]
training2 <- training2[, Remove_NA==F]

remove variables that don't make intuitive sense for prediction 

training1 <- training1[, -(1:5)]
training2 <- training2[, -(1:5)]

Fitting model on training1 

fitControl  <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=F)
Fit_model  <- train(classe ~ .,data=training1,method="rf",trControl=fitControl)
Fit_model$finalModel

Evaluating model on probing dataset

predicting classe labels of training2 using the fitted model on training 1 

preds <- predict(Fit_model, newdata=training2)

show confusion matrix to get estimate of out-of-sample error 

confusionMatrix(training2$classe, preds)

Building model

Before predicting on the test set, it is important to train the model on the full training set (training_data) .

remove variables with nearly zero variance 

nzv <- nearZeroVar(training_data)
training_data <- training_data[, -nzv]
training_data <- training_data[, -nzv]

remove variables with more than 95% missing values 

Remove_NA  <- sapply(training_data, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
training_data <- training_data[, Remove_NA==F]
testing_data <- testing_data[, Remove_NA==F]

remove variables that don't make intuitive sense for prediction 

training_data <- training_data[, -(1:5)]
testing_data <- testing_data[, -(1:5)]

re-fit model using full training set (training_data) 

fitControl  <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=F)
fit_modelf  <- train(classe ~ .,data=training_data,method="rf",trControl=fitControl)
fit_modelf$finalModel

Prediction on test data

using the model on training_data to predict the label for the observations in testing_data 

preds <- predict(fit_modelf, newdata=testing_data)

convert predictions to character vector 

preds <- as.character(preds)
preds
